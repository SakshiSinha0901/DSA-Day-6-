//Key Areas of Revision:
//Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: Itâ€™s crucial to understand how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. The common notations include:
O(n): Linear time
O(log n): Logarithmic time
O(n^2): Quadratic time
Space Complexity: This measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Efficient algorithms manage both time and space effectively.
Arrays:

Basics: How arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing constant-time access to elements via indexing.
Operations: From initialization, input/output operations, to advanced functions like fill().
Function Interactions: Understanding how to pass arrays to functions and the concepts of passing by value vs. passing by reference.
